## Water Politics

###Topic: 
I want to design a map that shows something interesting about water politics because I want to find out who has rights to water, who/what owns it, how it's used/dispersed, whether or not it's contaminated, etc. in order to help the user understand that access to water should be a basic human right, but (I strongly suspect) there is an increasing need to be vigilant and to pay attention to what states/cities are doing with public resources.

Exactly what I map will depend on the data sets that I'm able to find. This might be a series of maps covering different aspects of water politics in different parts of the US (or world?)
